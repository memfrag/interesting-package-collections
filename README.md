# Interesting Package Collections

Swift package collections that are interesting to me.

The Swift package collection JSON files can be added to Xcode from this repository.

### Adding the Collections to Xcode

Each JSON file in the root of the repository is a package collection specification. You can add them to Xcode using raw file github URLs:
